  # Bug Fixing Braces Error in PHPExcel Library
  This update addresses an issue encountered while using the PHPExcel library, where a syntax error occurs due to the use of { braces for array access, which is no longer    supported in newer versions of PHP.

To resolve this issue, I have made the necessary changes in the code by replacing { braces with [ brackets, which is the correct syntax. These changes ensure compatibility with the latest PHP versions and allow for error-free usage of the PHPExcel library.

Please review and merge this update to incorporate the fix for the braces error in PHPExcel.

Thank you for your attention and consideration.
